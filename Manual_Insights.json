[{"Manual_Insights":"Purpose: to improve dialogue systems by leveraging multiple user simulators simultaneously. Contribution: a new framework called MUST (Multi-user Simulator Training) for training task-oriented dialogue systems. MUST leverages multiple user simulators to train a dialogue system, with the goal of improving the system’s robustness to various user behaviors. Method: MUST (Multi-user Simulator Training). MUST addresses the challenge of training a dialogue system on a single user simulator, which can lead to the system being over-fitted to that specific simulator and under-fitted to others. MUST accomplishes this by leveraging multiple user simulators simultaneously. The authors propose three ways to implement MUST: MUSTmerging, MUSTCRL, and MUSTuniform. MUSTadaptive is the method ultimately chosen by the authors as it tackles the challenges of balancing exploration and exploitation, and avoiding catastrophic forgetting. MUSTadaptive utilizes an adaptively-updated distribution to select user simulators during training. Dataset: didn't find information may have used personal dataset. Conclusion: that MUST leads to a more robust dialogue system that can perform well with unseen user simulators. The authors propose a framework called MUST that leverages multiple user simulators to train task-oriented dialogue systems.

To forecast the overall toxicity and the toxicity of each word in its context, the MIL model is trained on a corpus where each text has a toxicity label. Intuitively, the MIL network augments the original language model to prevent toxicity by computing a toxicity distribution over subsequent tokens based on the created context. Both automated metrics and human evaluation are used to assess MIL-Decoding, and the results show that it performs better in detoxification than other baselines and has little negative effects on generation fluency.

These structures underlie complex anaphoric and agreement relations at the interface of syntax and semantics, allowing us to study lexically guided antecedent retrieval processes. Contribution: (i) the release of wide-covering and highly controlled datasets to evaluate control structures in Spanish and Galician, (ii) a psycholinguistic evaluation of humans’ performance, a computational evaluation of monolingual and multilingual LMs’ performance, and a careful comparison between humans and LMs; (iii) a demonstration of the limitations of LMs to capture grammatical information thanks to the adversarial example of control constructions. Method: This paper's methodological approach combines psycholinguistic tests and computer analysis in a multimodal way to investigate how control dependencies in Spanish phrases are understood. The study performs human acceptability evaluation tests and evaluates the effectiveness of several pre-trained language models (LMs) in detecting control structures using carefully designed datasets. The research systematically assesses human and LM comprehension and processing of control interdependence using three different experiments, including human assessment and LM prediction tasks.

For the main dataset, used in Experiments 1 and 2, the experimental materials consisted of 96 items that had 8 different versions (768 experimental sentences). Conclusion: The empirical evidence gathered in this work provides a very straightforward picture: whereas humans’ can coordinate lexico-semantic and syntactic information in order to determine the (un)acceptability of control structures, LMs resort to a heuristic based on linear proximity, disregarding control information. These findings are robust, as they replicate across tasks (acceptability and masked prediction), models (monolingual and multilingual), languages (Spanish and Galician LMs), and type of antecedent (names and pronouns).

However, their implementation in Open-LTG is hindered by the AR nature, which decreases the inference efficiency as generation duration increases. They also investigate the possibilities of pre-trained masked language models (MLMs) in conjunction with a representative iterative non-autoregressive (NAR) decoding technique for Open-LTG in order to increase inference efficiency. According to our first research, pre-trained MLMs are only capable of producing brief text; they will break down when it comes to modeling large texts. Contribution: The limits of autoregressive (AR) language models, such as BART and GPTs, with longer generations of data—a lower inference efficiency—in open-ended long text generation (OpenLTG are discussed in this study. To address this obstacle, it suggests utilizing non-autoregressive (NAR) decoding algorithms in combination with pre-trained masked language models (MLMs). The research presents novel approaches to address model collapse problems in MLMs during OpenLTG by introducing Dynamic Sliding Window Attention (DSWA) and Linear Temperature Decay (LTD). Experiments show notable gains in speed and performance, indicating that pre-trained MLMs are viable options for the OpenLTG community. Method: They propose two simple yet effective strategies for attention mechanism and inference to mitigate the model collapse problems: Dynamic Sliding Window Attention (DSWA) and Linear Temperature Decay (LTD). These designs do not break the paradigm of MLM so that it can flexibly adapt to the pre-trained models. Dataset: Experiments on two OpenLTG tasks (i.e., storytelling and multi-paragraph opinionated article writing) with four widely-used datasets. They use Writing Prompt (WP) and ROC Stories (ROC) datasets to conduct experiments for validating whether pre-trained MLMs can work better on Open-LTG tasks. Conclusion: This work investigates Open-LTG using NAR models that are trained on pre-trained MLMs. For open-ended text generation, They first looked at the capabilities and constraints of MLMs in conjunction with the iterative NAR inference. They found that MLMs would collapse for Open-LTG. After a thorough investigation and analysis, They determined that the improper attention mechanism and inference methodologies were to blame. Then presented two straightforward solutions to this issue: dynamic sliding window attention and linear temperature decay. Experiments show that our approach delivers a notable speedup and competitive performance. Our study aims to establish pre-trained MLMs as fresh prospects for the Open-LTG community. Future work: Paper’s primary concern focuses on accelerating the generation speed, and they will put how to solve these problems in future work. They will add grammar corrections for each iteration in future work to help the model produce better results.

Experiments show notable gains in speed and performance, indicating that pre-trained MLMs are viable options for the OpenLTG community.","Method":"They propose two simple yet effective strategies for attention mechanism and inference to mitigate the model collapse problems: Dynamic Sliding Window Attention (DSWA) and Linear Temperature Decay (LTD). These designs do not break the paradigm of MLM so that it can flexibly adapt to the pre-trained models.","Dataset":"Experiments on two OpenLTG tasks (i.e., storytelling and multi-paragraph opinionated article writing) with four widely-used datasets. They use Writing Prompt (WP) and ROC Stories (ROC) datasets to conduct experiments for validating whether pre-trained MLMs can work better on Open-LTG tasks.","Conclusion":"This work investigates Open-LTG using NAR models that are trained on pre-trained MLMs. For open-ended text generation, They first looked at the capabilities and constraints of MLMs in conjunction with the iterative NAR inference. They found that MLMs would collapse for Open-LTG. After a thorough investigation and analysis, They determined that the improper attention mechanism and inference methodologies were to blame. Then presented two straightforward solutions to this issue: dynamic sliding window attention and linear temperature decay. Experiments show that our approach delivers a notable speedup and competitive performance. Our study aims to establish pre-trained MLMs as fresh prospects for the Open-LTG community.","Future work":"Paper’s primary concern focuses on accelerating the generation speed, and they will put how to solve these problems in future work. They will add grammar corrections for each iteration in future work to help the model produce better results. They also will improve the text quality and overall fluency and solve the above problems for Open-LTG scenarios in future work."},{"Manual_Insights":"Purpose: Using extensive language models, they investigate semantic constructs in grammatical constructions. Firstly, the project word embeddings from context into three alternative interpretable semantic spaces, each with its own set of norms for psycholinguistic features. After validating these interpretable spaces, then apply them to automatically extract semantic characterizations of lexical items in two grammatical constructions: the AANN construction (e.g., 'a beautiful three days') and nouns in subject or object position inside the same sentence. It is demonstrated that a word in subject position is seen to be more agentive than the identical word in object position. Additionally, nouns in the AANN construction are understood to be more measurement-like than they are in the standard alternation paradigm. Contribution: The study uses extensive language models and interpretable semantic spaces to present a novel method for comprehending semantic constructs within grammatical constructions. Through mapping psycholinguistic feature norms to contextual word embeddings, the approach provides insights into the semantic properties of lexical items within particular constructions. This advances our knowledge of how language constructs meaning and offers a useful tool for examining syntactic phenomena that are not as well understood. The approach advances linguistic research by facilitating the automatic extraction of semantic characterizations and provides a flexible methodology that can be applied to different linguistic domains. Method: Learning to map the contextual word embedding space to an interpretable space defined by feature norms, where each dimension corresponds to a semantic feature, is the task at hand. By matching embeddings from contextual word vectors with feature norms, they build the training set. They train models at the type level, such as the one depicted in the upper half of Figure 1, mapping the embedding vectors for the word ring to the set of feature norms for ring. Ultimately, however, they forecast semantic characteristics for specific tokens using the model. By projecting the token vector of a single instance of the word 'ring' into the feature space discovered at the type-level, as illustrated in the lower portion of Figure1. Dataset: They have constructed three semantic spaces, trained from three datasets of psycholinguistic feature norms. The feature norms comprise 541 concrete English nouns and 2,526 features.The feature norms consist of over 4000 English words and 3,981 distinct features, from all open-class parts of speech, and include abstract words. The data consists of 535 English words rated for the relevance of 65 predefined features. Conclusion: In this paper, they honed techniques for predicting semantic features for token embeddings. These projections are versatile. Once created, one and the same model can be used to study a wide array of phenomena. They explored their utility for studying semantic construal in syntactic constructions.

While recent CCG supertagging and parsing models show good performance overall, they implicitly model phrase structure dependencies using black-box neural architectures. Rather, they make use of the technique of holographic embeddings as a compositional operator to explicitly model the dependencies within the embedding space between phrase structures and words. According to experimental results, when utilizing a C&C parser, holographic composition effectively increases the supertagging accuracy to achieve state-of-the-art parsing performance.

They present Lottery Prompt Tuning (LPT), a novel parameter- and deployment-efficient prompt tuning technique, in order to accomplish these three goals. Using a binary prompt mask, LPT freezes the PLM's parameters and sequentially learns compact pruned prompt vectors for each task, leaving the prompt parameters chosen by earlier tasks unaffected. Furthermore, they demonstrate the potent transferability of Lottery Prompts to novel tasks and perform mask selection using a straightforward yet efficient method. Contribution: introduces a challenging benchmark for universal information extraction (UIE) systems in lifelong learning scenarios. The authors propose a novel method called Lottery Prompt Tuning (LPT), which freezes pre-trained language model parameters and sequentially learns compact pruned prompt vectors for each task. LPT achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates powerful transferability to novel tasks, ensuring robust adaptation and generalization. Method: Figure 2 depicts the general LPT procedure. They simultaneously learn the prompt vectors and a paired task-aware binary prompt mask in order to continuously learn new IE tasks. The mask's purpose is to generate a pruned prompt, such as the Lottery Prompt. To promote knowledge transfer, LPT can selectively reuse previously learned prompt parameters during training for each incoming task. Only soft prompt parameters that haven't been chosen by prior tasks are updated with new parameters. Ultimately, the model solves catastrophic forgetting by using binary masks to isolate the share parameters and obtain the lottery prompt for each task, even though it shares the same set of soft prompts for all tasks. Dataset: They formalize the lifelong UIE benchmark by using 13 IE datasets to build the task sequence, covering all four common IE task types (NER, relation extraction, event extraction, and sentiment extraction).

With the help of these retrieval-augmented techniques, models can explicitly and non-parametrically gain prior external knowledge, using the retrieved reference instances as cues to improve text generation. These techniques make use of similarity-based retrieval, which is predicated on the straightforward idea that the likelihood that the demonstration label will resemble the input label increases with the degree to which the retrieved demonstration resembles the original input. This theory, however, is not always true in document-level EAE because of the sparsity of event arguments and the complexity of event labels. Contribution: It, greatly advances the field of natural language processing (NLP), especially in the area of document-level event argument extraction (EAE). The paper improves text generation processes by incorporating retrieval-augmented strategies into the EAE framework, which improves the models' ability to incorporate external knowledge. This breakthrough expands the use of retrieval-augmented techniques in generative NLP tasks and improves the performance of EAE models. The authors present a novel method that improves the model's analogical ability and enables the generation of reference vectors as depth cues, further enhancing the comprehension and contextuality of the generated text. This is achieved through their proposed adaptive hybrid retrieval augmentation paradigm. Method: They use the same formulation of document level EAE as Ebner et al. (2020). A document x = {w1, w2,..., w|x|} has a set of events E that are described. Every event e ∈ E has a trigger (a text span in x) that designates it, along with its event type (t). A role set Rt is specified for each event type t. The event type and the role set that goes along with it make up the event schema e.

By incorporating AMRs into the Path Aggregation Relational Network (APARN) model, sentiment classification accuracy is improved by providing a more thorough comprehension of the relationship between aspects and contexts. Furthermore, relation-enhanced self-attention mechanism and path aggregator enable efficient information integration between original sentences and AMRs, resolving parser unreliability concerns and resulting in better performance than current baselines.

Furthermore, relation-enhanced self-attention mechanism and path aggregator enable efficient information integration between original sentences and AMRs, resolving parser unreliability concerns and resulting in better performance than current baselines.","Dataset":"They use four widely used public standard datasets for their experiments. The Restaurant and Laptop dataset is derived from the SemEval 2014 Task (Pontiki et al., 2014), whereas the Twitter dataset is a compilation of tweets created by Dong et al. (2014). Jiang et al. have made available MAMS, a large-scale multi-aspect dataset (2019).","Conclusion":"They present the AMR-based Path Aggregation Relational Network for ABSA, or APARN, in this paper. Their model uses the Abstract Meaning Representation semantic structure, which is more in line with the sentiment analysis task, as opposed to the traditional ABSA model, which uses a syntactic structure like a dependency tree. For effective AMR exploitation and information integration between AMRs and input sentences, they suggest the path aggregator and the relation-enhanced selfattention mechanism. Their model is able to outperform other models thanks to these designs. According to experiments conducted on four public datasets, APARN performs better than rival baselines.","Future work":"In the future, APARN with higher quality AMRs is expected to further improve the level of the ABSA task. They will further generalize it. to more complex sentiment analysis tasks in the future work."},{"Manual_Insights":"Purpose: They present a brand-new adversarial purification technique that is centered on fending off textual adversarial attacks. By masking input texts and reconstructing the masked texts using the masked language models, they can introduce noise with the aid of language models. By doing this, they build a process of adversarial purification for textual models that defends against the most popular adversarial attacks, which involve word substitution. They test a number of powerful adversarial attack techniques, such as Textfooler and BERT-Attack, with their suggested adversarial purification method. The experimental findings show that the purification algorithm is capable of successfully fending off strong word-substitution attacks. Contribution: They bring up the issue of fending off adversarial attacks based on substitution without addressing the attacks' form in NLP tasks. To the best of their knowledge, they were the first to combine text adversarial purification with pre-trained models and to take into account adversarial purification as a defense against textual adversarial attacks, such as strong word-substitution attacks. Method: The work makes a substantial contribution to the development of adversarial defense strategies for tasks involving natural language processing (NLP). The authors tackle the urgent problem of thwarting adversarial attacks, especially those that involve word substitution, by presenting a novel adversarial purification technique designed especially for textual models. In order to create an adversarial purification process, their method consists of masking input texts, reconstructing them using masked language models, and introducing noise through language models. They show how well their method works to thwart strong word-substitution attacks through thorough testing against formidable adversarial attack techniques like Textfooler and BERT-Attack, as well as through rigorous experimentation on widely used text classification datasets. Dataset: In their experiments, they make use of two popular text classification datasets: AG's News 2 (Zhang et al., 2015) and IMDB 1 (Maas et al., 2011). The AG's News dataset is a four-class news genre classification task; the IMDB dataset is a bi-polar movie review classification task. In the IMDB dataset, the average length is 220 words, while in the AG's News dataset, it is 40 words. Since the attacking process is significantly slowed down when the model is defensive, they use the test set that comes after the Textfooler 1k test set in the main result and sample 100 samples for the remaining experiments. Conclusion: To counter substitution-based adversarial attacks, they present a textual adversarial purification algorithm in this paper. They recover noisy texts by using pre-trained models' mask-infill capability, and then they use these cleaned texts to generate predictions. Tests demonstrate that the purification technique works well against powerful adversarial attacks without taking into account their substitution range. While prior adversarial purification strategy successes have primarily focused on the image field. Future work: They are the first to consider the adversarial purification method with a multiple-recovering strategy in the text domain. Thus, they anticipate that the adversarial purification technique will be further investigated in NLP applications as an effective defensive tactic.","Purpose":"They present a brand-new adversarial purification technique that is centered on fending off textual adversarial attacks.

Contribution: It introduces a novel causal framework for evaluating LLM performance in math word problems and this framework separates the influence of different factors (wording, numbers, operations) on the model's solution. It applies the framework to showcase its effectiveness and identify a particularly robust model (GPT-3 Davinci). Method: we use is the concept of the casual NLP, which explores causal relationships in natural language processing.

This allows researchers to pinpoint which factors the model relies on most heavily and is then applied to test LLMs on a collection of math word problems. Dataset: Here we use the existing Math Word Problem datasets. Conclusion: Here in the paper, size of the LLM model doesn't directly correlate with robustness in math reasoning.

Purpose: Here the authors aimed to develop a new method for automatically evaluating open-domain dialogue systems. Existing metrics often struggle with responses that are semantically different but still relevant to the conversation. Contribution: The paper proposes CMN, a novel method that leverages Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) with Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) and Mutual Information (MI) for dialogue system evaluation. This approach addresses the limitations of current metrics by focusing on semantic coherence and relevance between the context and response. Method: Authors focused on are evaluate CMN on two dialogue datasets and they compare CMN to various baseline metrics used for dialogue evaluation, encompassing reference-based, embedding-based, and learning-based approaches. They also assess how CMN handles responses with varying semantic similarity, two evaluation sets are created: standard (similar responses) and diverse (semantically distant responses).  Dataset: Authors used two dialogue datasets , those are PersonaChat Dataset and DailyDialog DatasetConclusion: In this paper they found that CMN outperforms all baseline metrics in terms of correlation with human annotations on both standard and diverse evaluation sets. This signifies CMN's effectiveness in evaluating responses with varying degrees of semantic similarity to the reference response. CMN utilizes CVAEs with NSP and MI to capture semantic coherence and relevance, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing metrics, especially for responses with varying semantic similarity. The paper highlights the limitation of CMN focusing only on large-scale semantic dependencies. Future work: It will involve 'disentanglement studies' to analyze text based on various attributes considered in human evaluation (e.g., sentiment, humor).

Existing metrics often struggle with responses that are semantically different but still relevant to the conversation. Contribution: The paper proposes CMN, a novel method that leverages Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) with Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) and Mutual Information (MI) for dialogue system evaluation. This approach addresses the limitations of current metrics by focusing on semantic coherence and relevance between the context and response. Method: Authors focused on are evaluate CMN on two dialogue datasets and they compare CMN to various baseline metrics used for dialogue evaluation, encompassing reference-based, embedding-based, and learning-based approaches. They also assess how CMN handles responses with varying semantic similarity, two evaluation sets are created: standard (similar responses) and diverse (semantically distant responses).  Dataset: Authors used two dialogue datasets, those are PersonaChat Dataset and DailyDialog DatasetConclusion: In this paper they found that CMN outperforms all baseline metrics in terms of correlation with human annotations on both standard and diverse evaluation sets. This signifies CMN's effectiveness in evaluating responses with varying degrees of semantic similarity to the reference response. CMN utilizes CVAEs with NSP and MI to capture semantic coherence and relevance, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing metrics, especially for responses with varying semantic similarity. The paper highlights the limitation of CMN focusing only on large-scale semantic dependencies. Future work: It will involve 'disentanglement studies' to analyze text based on various attributes considered in human evaluation (e.g., sentiment, humor). This could improve model performance and interpretability. Purpose: to improve the machine translation (MT) by evaluating how well models handle discourse phenomena that rely on context across sentences. Contribution: The main contribution is MuDA, where it evaluates MT on its ability to consider text during translation. It identifies and assesses various phenomena in translations.Method: The authors propose a method called PCXMI, a metric to measure how much context affects a model's translation choices. They then use PCXMI to develop MuDA, a data-driven approach that analyzes parallel translated documents across 14 languages. MuDA automatically tags words requiring context for accurate translation.Dataset: There is no dataset used, instead the authors use parallel translated documents from TED Talks, encompassing 14 languages. Conclusion: From this paper we found that MT models aren’t good at handling phenomena identified by MuDA. We need some improvement in MT. Future work: In future use, they call for further development of MT models specifically focused on improving context-aware translation. MuDA paves the way for more targeted evaluation and future advancements in MT.","Purpose":"Here the authors aimed to develop a new method for automatically evaluating open-domain dialogue systems.

Contribution: It introduces two text diversification approaches using LLMs and analyzes their impact on model accuracy and evaluates two human intervention methods to improve the accuracy of models trained on diversified datasets. It also identifies limitations in the current approach and proposes future work directions. Method: Authors implemented two text diversification techniques (logit suppression & high temperature) to increase the variety of generated text. To improve the accuracy of the generated data, human intervention involves replacing incorrect labels with more suitable ones and filtering out-of-scope instances (OOSF) that don't belong to the desired category. Dataset: In this no data set is used, as most of the input data is Text Data. Conclusion: The findings in the paper are diversification techniques successfully generate more diverse text data, but this comes at the cost of reduced accuracy in assigning labels.Future work: In future, we will develop methods for training proxy models throughout the LLM text generation process to address data imbalance. We also design better OOSF strategies like filtering based on various criteria and testing the approach with a wider range of LLM models and prompts.

By this it also demonstrates that SMP achieves better accuracy than previous methods, especially at high sparsity levels (when many weights are removed).

Psycholinguistic bias refers to the tendency of fake news articles to use emotionally charged language, which can mislead training models. Image-only bias occurs when a model assigns a news label based solely on the image content, even if the image itself is unrelated to the news article.Method:  The method involves causal intervention to remove the effect of emotional language in text features during training, and counterfactual reasoning to estimate the effect of the image alone on the label by imagining a scenario where the model only sees the image and not the text.Dataset:  The authors used two benchmark datasets: Twitter and Pheme, which contain text and image data labelled as real or fake news.
